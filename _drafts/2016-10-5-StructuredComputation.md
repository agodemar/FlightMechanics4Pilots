__Periodic table__: AND, OR, XOR, ... Hadamard, CNOT,

__Molecules__: Shors algorithm, fast fourier transform, ??

We can write these as matrixes and make molecules by letting them react with each other?
Aka TensorNetworks, where elements (AND, OR, ...) are connected with other elements (the connection depending on?) and thus form an algorithm/molecule. This molecule as structure, symmetries, ???
