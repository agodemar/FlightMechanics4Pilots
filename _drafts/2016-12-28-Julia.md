ccall
metaprogramming


##### Multiple dispatch (in Julia)

```c
# Overloading the * operator
*(a::Number, g::Function)= x->a*g(x) # Scale output
*(f::Function,t::Number) = x->f(t*x) # Scale argument
*(f::Function,g::Function)= x->f(g(x)) # Function composition

# Overloading the backslash operator, \
# For solving Ax = b efficiently in different cases.
\(A::Diagonal, b::Vector)= x->m/d # Scale output
\(A::Sparse,b::Vector) = x->sparse_least_squares(m,b) # Scale argument
\(A::TriSymDiag,b::Vector)= x->TriSymDiag(m,b) #
```

A picture of this could be nice? A router. (could be done with a net?)

Interesting trade-off?

* More memory, more specialisation, less use, less general, fast
* Less memory, ... one shoe fits all...

(ultimately, we want each to be able to inform the others about better ways to work. other wise we just have a collection of individuals. no collaboration.)
