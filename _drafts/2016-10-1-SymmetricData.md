title: What do symmetries in problems imply aboutâ€¦
category: notes
---

How does the structure of a problem determine the structure of efficient solutions? How do efficient solutions reflect the structure of the problem they were designed to solve? What symmetries are there between them? How does structure (of a solution/algorithm) determine function (the problems it can solve)? Function is structure!

Images are naturally invariant to translation (and some other variables - rotations, size, colour...) and convolutions are commonly used for images, why? Because if we could imagine the transformations done by convolutions as some sort of structure we would see that they are invariant to translation.
