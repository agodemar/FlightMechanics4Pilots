Types are the solution! The solution to what?

### What are types?

* Numerical
  * `int32`
  * `float32`
  * `unit8`
* Data structures
  * `list`
  *


They are different ways to represent information.

### The problem.

Types actually solve a couple of related problems; safety, efficiency, modular/communication,

* Inferring the structure of information can be expensive.
* Attempting to interpret one type as another can lead to errors.
*

Fundamentally this is about using any/all information we have about a problem to process it in the most efficient way.

We can take this further and think about [parametric types](http://docs.julialang.org/en/stable/manual/types/#man-parametric-types)
as telling us about some structure in the object, rather than fully defining it.

Much like `type(x) = bool` tells us that x is either `True` or `False`, type(x) =

```python
type Point{T}
    x::T
    y::T
end
```
