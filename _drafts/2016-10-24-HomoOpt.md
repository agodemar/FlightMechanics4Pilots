title: Homotopic optimisation

Imagine we have a composition of functions, $f_1 \circ f_2 \circ f_3 \circ f_4 \circ f_5$ which is equivalent to $(1)
f_5(f_4(f_3(f_2(f_1(x)))))$. Then we can write this as just some higher-function $(2) F(x) = f_5(f_4(f_3(f_2(f_1(x)))))$.

* What is the difference between (1) and (2)? Is this similar to the difference between causal and lagrangian (optimal) mechanics?
* So using homotopy type theory we can view data being transformed by (1) as a path through some type space. What if we know the end points (data,labels) but need a path? What if we want to find the shortest path?
* How is this related to optimisation?
