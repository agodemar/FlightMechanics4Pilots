title: Axioms of linear algebra
category: extra

1. Associativity of addition
* Commutativity of addition
* Identity element of addition
* Inverse elements of addition
* Distributivity of scalar multiplication with respect to vector addition
* Distributivity of scalar multiplication with respect to field addition
* Compatibility of scalar multiplication with field multiplication
* Identity element of scalar multiplication

Translating this into something more interpretable?
Play with subtle changes and try to understand why these axioms are __the__ axioms.

***

* What if LinAlg wasnt associative, or commutative
* What if over a ring instead of a field. e.g.g an integral domain.


Find counter examples?!?
