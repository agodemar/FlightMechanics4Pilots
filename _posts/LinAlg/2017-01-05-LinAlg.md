<!-- Options.
* Cover linalg but start from the composition of linear functions?
* Make up some other basis of linear maps that satisfies the axioms.
* derive linalg from different axioms?
* a collection of proofs of random/interesting bits and pieces.
  * kronecker, schur, rank,

_The essence of linear algebra._
See [this](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)
awesome set of tutorials and my [attempts]({{ baseurl }}/EssenceofLinAlg) to distill the essence of linear
algebra.

> If you want to push a crate, and you don't want it to spin while you're pushing it, the direction you have to push it in is an eigenvector. The amount it moves in proportion to how hard you push it is an eigenvalue https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2601/best-intuitive-metaphors-for-math-concepts-of-any-level?rq=1

## Vector spaces and linear transforms

* [Functions]({{ gist }}/linearfunctions) which leads us to guassian elimination.
* [Vectors]({{ gist }}/linearvectors) which leads us to ??
* [?](??) diy version


The efficient implementation of a well known transform.

## Arrays

[dense vs sparse]({{ baseurl }}/SparseArrays)

## Embedded algebras and representational power

[embedding]({{ baseurl }}/EmbedLinAlg)


The weird/awesome fact that a linear transformation/function is just an array.
So both objects and morphisms can be represented by the same structure, given
a process for combining them. (or is that process the morphism?)
