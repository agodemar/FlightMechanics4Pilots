# Introduction

Aircraft require a support from the atmosphere called the lift in order to sustain
themselves in flight. Aircraft are broadly separated into
*lighter-than-air* (LTA) and *heavier-than-air* (or aerodynamic lifting) vehicles, depending,
respectively, upon whether the lift is produced by buoyancy, or by the motion of
the vehicle (or a part of the vehicle) through the air. Into the LTA category fall the
balloons and airships, while the aerodynamic lifting vehicles are classified as being
either *fixed-wing*, or *rotary-wing* craft depending upon whether their wings are fixed
or rotary relative to the main structure. The fixed-wing aircraft include the airplanes
and the gliders, whereas the rotary-wing vehicles (also termed the rotorcraft) are
the helicopters and autogyros. Although there is no flapping-wing flight vehicle
currently in operation, they can be thought of as being aerodynamic vehicles in a
class separate from the fixed-wing and the rotary-wing vehicles.
