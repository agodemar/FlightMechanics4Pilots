# The Anatomy of Conventional Aircraft Configurations

This section introduces a set of definitions pertaining the architecture of conventional fixed-wing airplanes, which are useful in the discussion of aircraft performance characteristics. Since pilots already possess a knowledge of aircraft fundamentals by training, the concepts introduced here are more oriented towards and flight theory.

The figure below represents a conventional three-axis architecture aircraft and a reference frame $$\{ G, x, y, z \}$$ fixed with vehicle.

The above cartesian reference is called *body-frame*, having the origin at the aircraft center of gravity (CoG) $G$ and the three oriented as shown. For this reason the *body-axes* are also named $x_\mathrm{B}$, $y_\mathrm{B}$, and $z_\mathrm{B}$.
