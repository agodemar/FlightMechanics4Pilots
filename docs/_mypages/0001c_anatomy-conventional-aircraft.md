# The Anatomy of Conventional Aircraft Configurations

This section introduces a set of definitions pertaining the architecture of conventional fixed-wing airplanes, which are useful in the discussion of aircraft performance characteristics. Since pilots already possess a knowledge of aircraft fundamentals by training, the concepts introduced here are more oriented towards and flight theory.

## Aircraft Body Axes

The figure below represents a conventional three-axis architecture aircraft and a reference frame $$\{ G, x, y, z \}$$ fixed with vehicle.

  %}

The above cartesian reference is called *body-frame*, having the origin at the aircraft center of gravity (CoG) $G$ and the three oriented as shown. For this reason the *body-axes* are also named $x_\mathrm{B}$, $y_\mathrm{B}$, and $z_\mathrm{B}$.

## Planform definitions

The figure below shows a top view af an aircraft.

  %}

Two of the quantities that characterize the wing planform are also shown: the total span $b=2s$, and the mean chord $\bar{c}$ --- taken over all the chords $c(y)$ at wing sections $y$ for $-\frac{b}{2} \le y \le +\frac{b}{2}$.

## Wing-Fuselage definitions

A more detailed nomenclature is given by the next drawing, representing a top and a side view of a wing-fuselage combination.

  width="65%"
  description="Nomenclature of wing-fuselage combination (side view)."
  %}

The axes $x_\mathrm{C}$, $y_\mathrm{C}$, and $z_\mathrm{C}$ are what designers call *construction axes*. Like the body-axes, also the construction axes are fixed with the aircraft but are oriented differently. In the above illustration the various quantities are used to identify the position of the wing relative to the fuselage body.
