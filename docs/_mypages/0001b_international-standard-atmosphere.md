# The International Standard Atmosphere (ISA)

The knowledge of standard atmosphere is required for producing pressure instruments,
performing data reductions of flight tests, and pronouncing certain safety regulations
for the aircraft.

The physical characteristics of the atmosphere are not steady and constant but
change with altitude, location (longitude and latitude) on the globe, season, and
time of the day, and with the solar sunspot activity. The performance of an
aircraft depends on the physical characteristics of the atmospheric air through
which it flies. The performance data of an aircraft or comparison of the performance
of different aircraft have meaning only if they are considered with respect to
some commonly agreed upon *reference atmosphere*. This reference atmosphere
is usually the standard atmosphere, where the temperature, pressure, and
density vary with altitude only. The fixation of standard atmosphere allows for the
design of instruments for measuring altitude and airspeed. The pressure altitude,
temperature altitude, and density altitude have meaning only after the standard
atmosphere has been specified.

It is presently possible to specify the prevailing atmospheric conditions up to
an altitude of 2000 km at any latitude and longitude of our globe. If desired,
each country can have its own standard atmosphere. For general aviation purposes
it is pertinent to develop internationally known reference atmosphere. Several
reference atmospheric models have been established.

A number of standard versions exist: NACA's atmosphere (1955), the ARDC (1959),
the US standard (1962, amended in 1976) and the ICAO standard.
These tables are basically equivalent to each other up to about 20 km (65000 ft),
that covers most of the atmospheric flight mechanics.
We shall be concerned with altitudes below 31 km, or about 100000ft.
