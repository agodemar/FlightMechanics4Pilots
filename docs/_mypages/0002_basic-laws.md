# Basic Laws of Motion

The basic laws of motion are applied to any moving, solid object.
For the sake of simplicity, the moving object is idealized to be
a concentrated mass $m$, i.e. a point, hence it has no physical dimensions.
The motion of a point in a three-dimensional space is termed translation.

Isaac Newton proposed the following three basic laws of motion in his
revolutionary work dated 1687, titled *Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica*
(“Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy”):

1. A particle moving in a *straight line* at a constant speed $V$ will continue
   to do so unless a *force* $\mathbf{F}$ acts upon it.

2. The time *rate* of change of the velocity
   — i.e., the *acceleration* $\mathbf{a} = \mathrm{d} \mathbf{V}/\mathrm{d}t$ —
   of a particle is directly proportional to the force acting upon it.
   The constant of proportionality is the *mass* of the object
   — $\mathbf{F} = m \mathbf{a}$.

   By defining the product of the mass of the particle with its velocity as its
   *linear momentum* $\mathbf{Q} = m \mathbf{V}$, it is implied that the time rate
   of change of the linear momentum vector is equal to the force applied to the particle
   \\[
     \mathbf{F} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{Q}}{\mathrm{d}t}
       = \frac{\mathrm{d}\big( m \mathbf{V} \big)}{\mathrm{d}t}
     \label{eq:Newton:Second:Law}
  \\]

3. If a particle exerts a force on another particle, the second particle
   simultaneously exerts a force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction
   on the first. The second force is called a reaction to the first force.

 Newton's laws are valid only for an inertial observer. Such an observer, by
 definition, must not be undergoing any acceleration; otherwise the velocity and
 acceleration measured by her would not satisfy Newton's laws.

Newton's first law of motion implies that the velocity of a moving particle
is a vector $\mathbf{V}$ whose magnitude (speed $V = |\mathbf{V}|$) and direction
(straight-line motion) remain constant with time, until and unless an external
agency — force $\mathbf{F}$ in Eqn. (\ref{eq:Newton:Second:Law}) — acts upon it.
This is the basic property (*inertia*) possessed by all objects having mass.

Many common flight situations involve a straight-line motion of the vehicle at
a nearly constant speed — e.g., an airplane flying steadily and level or climbing
at a constant rate, or a glider descending at a fixed glide angle.
In such a flight, all the force vectors on the vehicle (regarded as a particle)
must add to zero, otherwise, by the first law, either the speed or the direction
of the vehicle will change with time.

The equilibrium condition where all the forces on a vehicle are balanced
(i.e., sum to zero) is a natural atmospheric flight state, requiring the smallest
energy expenditure for a given range. Observe that such an equilibrium state does
not exist for space flight vehicles, which are always pulled toward the center of
a massive body by gravity. Similarly, an airplane either taking-off, or
performing maneuvers, has an accelerated flight condition where the forces are
unbalanced.
