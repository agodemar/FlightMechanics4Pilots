# Aerodynamic Pitching Moment

## Center of Pressure (CP)

The aerodynamic interaction of a wing with an air current determines a distribution of
varying local pressures and tangential stresses on the external surface. This is also called the *wet surface* of the wing.
The same concept applies to all remaining parts of an aircraft that are exposed to the flow, such as the external shape of the fuselage
as well as the wet surfaces of tailplanes.

The local pressures and tangential stresses, provided they are multiplied by the area $\mathrm{d}\mathcal{S}$ of the elemental wet surface,
represent a *system of applied forces*. In general, these forces ar non-coplanar and non-parallel yet they can be resolved into an *equivalent single force*
represented by the resultant, applied along a well determined axis. The resultant is a representative force which has the same physical effect on a given
body, in our case the aircraft, as the group of forces it replaces. In aerodynamics this conceptual process is known as *reduction* of the overall aerodynamic
action of the airflow on the airplane *to the resultant aerodynamic force*, applied to *center of pressure*. Actually, the resultant can be applied to any given
point of its line of action. In practice, for instance when airfoils are considered, typically the aerodynamic resultant is applied on a point on the chord,
i.e. the center of pressure is represented on the chord. The same is done for finite wings for which the center of pressure is taken on the root chord.
