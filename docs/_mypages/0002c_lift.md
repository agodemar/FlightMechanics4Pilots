# The Airplane Lift

The lift of airplanes is given by the following conventional equations:o the particle
\\[
  L = \frac{2}{2} \rho V^2 S \, C_{L}
  \label{eq:Lift:Equation}
\\]

The drag of airplanes is given by the following conventional equations:o the particle
\\[
  D = \frac{2}{2} \rho V^2 S \, C_{D}
  \label{eq:Drag:Equation}
\\]
