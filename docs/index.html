<p>
This material addresses an important gap in the aerospace literature by presenting
flight mechanics in an accessible manner. It covers the atmospheric flight mechanics of
aircraft in simple terms and purely on physical principles.
The focus is on explaining the important physical principles through simple examples
and illustrations.

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
Aircraft require a support from the atmosphere called the lift in order to sustain
themselves in flight. A further classification based upon the mechanism by which
the lift is produced is thus natural. Aircraft are broadly separated into
lighter-than-air (LTA) and heavier-than-air (or aerodynamic lifting) vehicles, depending,
respectively, upon whether the lift is produced by buoyancy, or by the motion of
the vehicle (or a part of the vehicle) through the air. Into the LTA category fall the
balloons and airships, while the aerodynamic lifting vehicles are classified as being
either fixed-wing, or rotary-wing craft depending upon whether their wings are fixed
or rotary relative to the main structure. The fixed-wing aircraft include the airplanes
and the gliders, whereas the rotary-wing vehicles (also termed the rotorcraft) are
the helicopters and autogyros. Although there is no flapping-wing flight vehicle
currently in operation, they can be thought of as being aerodynamic vehicles in a
class separate from the fixed-wing and the rotary-wing vehicles.

<h3>Testing Mathjax</h3>

This is the well-known conventional formula for lift:

$$L = \frac{1}{2}\rho V^2 S \, C_L \label{eq:lift}$$

In Eq. (\ref{eq:lift}) the coefficient $C_L$ is called coefficient of lift.
