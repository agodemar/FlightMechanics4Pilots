This material introduces aircraft flight mechanics and performance in an
accessible manner. It covers all the inherent concepts in simple terms and
relies on purely physical principles.
The important physical laws underlying the study of airplanes moving through
the air are explained by means of simple examples and illustrations.
The main goal of this effort is providing an introductory overview of the
mechanics of flight that conforms with the typical background of military pilots.
</p>
<p>
A basic but solid knowledge in physics and mathematics is required, although
the peculiar concepts of flight physics will be presented with the due consideration
of pilots attitude to the subject matter.

There are several textbooks available on the broad subject of Flight Mechanics.
Some of them are listed in
